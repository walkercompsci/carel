        <h1 class="top">Ethics</h1>
        <p class="long">Our ethical principles are the values that set the ground rules for all that we do as
            community volunteers. As we seek to achieve responsible success, we will be
            challenged to balance these principles, always mindful of our promise to achieve
            responsible success.

            Our Ethical Principles Are:
            <br>
            <strong>HONESTY</strong> : WE will not say things that are false. We will never deliberately
            mislead. We will be as candid as possible, openly and freely sharing information
            as appropriate to the relationship.
            <br>
            <strong>PROMISE KEEPING</strong>: We will go to great lengths to keep our commitments. We
            will not make promises that can't be kept and we will not make promises on behalf
            of Carel Associates unless we have the authority to do so.
            <br>
            <strong>FAIRNESS</strong>: We will create and follow a process and achieve outxcomes that a
            reasonable person would call just, evenhanded, and non-arbitrary.
            <br>
            <strong>RESPECT FOR OTHERS</strong>: We will be open and direct in our communications
            and receptive to influence. We will honor and value the abilities and contributions
            of others, embracing the responsibility and accountability for our actions in this
            regard.
            <br>
            <strong>COMPASSION</strong>: We will maintain an awaremess of the needs of others and act
            to meet those needs whenever possible. We will also minimize harm whenever
            possible. We will act in ways that are consistent with our commitment to social
            responsibility.
            <br>
            <strong>INTEGRITY</strong>: We will live up to our ethical principles, even when confronted by
            peraonal, professional, and social risks, as well as economic pressures</p>
