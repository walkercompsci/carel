        <h1>Sigma Omega Sigma (SOS) Student Volunteer Chapter</h1>
        <p>It is our goal to establish 5 new SOS chapters in each of the remaining Hendricks County High School communities. Each Chapter will enroll 10 Qualified Vetted High School Freshmen Students who are interested in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) careers. A Community Liaison will directly oversee student volunteer activities (similar to a scoutmaster). Starting with the graduation of the first 10 Chapter volunteers, this format will enable each Chapter to graduate 10 “College Ready” students each year.</p>

            about the college admissions and financial aid processes. These educational
            presentations are rendered online, in classrooms, and Town Hall type public
            meetings. This education provides guidance, hope, encouragement and
