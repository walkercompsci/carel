                    <p>Our ethical principles are the values that set the ground rules for all that we do as
                        community volunteers. As we seek to achieve responsible success, we will be
                        challenged to balance these principles, always mindful of our promise to achieve
                        responsible success.
            
                        Our Ethical Principles Are:

                        <strong>HONESTY</strong> : WE will not say things that are false. We will never deliberately
                        mislead. We will be as candid as possible, openly and freely sharing information
                        as appropriate to the relationship.
                        <br>
                        <strong>PROMISE KEEPING</strong>: We will go to great lengths to keep our commitments. We
                        will not make promises that can't be kept and we will not make promises on behalf
                        of Carel Associates unless we have the authority to do so.
                        <br>
                        <strong>FAIRNESS</strong>: We will create and follow a process and achieve outxcomes that a
                        reasonable person would call just, evenhanded, and non-arbitrary.
                        <br>
                        <strong>RESPECT FOR OTHERS</strong>: We will be open and direct in our communications
                        and receptive to influence. We will honor and value the abilities and contributions
                        of others, embracing the responsibility and accountability for our actions in this
                        regard.
                        <br>
                        <strong>COMPASSION</strong>: We will maintain an awaremess of the needs of others and act
                        to meet those needs whenever possible. We will also minimize harm whenever
                        possible. We will act in ways that are consistent with our commitment to social
                        responsibility.
